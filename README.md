Hi! My name is Su-Ting Tan and I am a rising sophomore studying Managerial Economics. I'm currently an Onboarding Associate and Recruiter for Bit Project. I help onboard new members and assist them with any questions that they may have. I also help with recruiting and reaching out to potential students who might be interested in joining our team.
